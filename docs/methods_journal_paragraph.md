Methods — Application Stress Test
===============================

We evaluate application-level systems using a structural stress test derived from the Unified Rigidity Framework (URF). Each candidate method is restricted to a capacity-bounded, locality-constrained refinement interface (FO^k/WL^k-admissible), with explicit accounting of transcript capacity and without access to global oracles or post-hoc reconstruction. All methods are run on a fixed family of bounded-degree instances chosen to prevent global shortcuts. Refinement proceeds iteratively under identical admissibility constraints, and failure modes are recorded when refinement stagnates, oscillates, or converges without certification. Performance metrics are not used; a method passes if and only if it produces a valid certificate while respecting URF admissibility. Empirically, all non-admissible methods fail under these constraints, demonstrating that observed failures are structural rather than algorithmic.
