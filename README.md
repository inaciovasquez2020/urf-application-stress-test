URF Application Stress Test — SAT

Purpose
Demonstrate that competing approaches fail to certify guarantees without URF admissibility axioms.

Scope
Boolean SAT under bounded-degree, FO^k-admissible refinement.

Method
Each method is run against the same instance family.
Failure is structural, not algorithmic.

Status
Canonical and frozen.
